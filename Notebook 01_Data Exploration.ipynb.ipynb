Open Legal Data\nprovides this corpus through a web interface, bulk downloads and a REST API. By doing so, Open Legal\nData aims to enhance the transparency of the jurisdiction with the help of open data and by supporting\npeople without legal education to understand the justice system, in line with the Open-Data Principles and\nthe Free Access to Law movement.\n# Case Study Problem\nBy transforming raw legal text into structured evidence, the project shows how judicial and legislative\nsignals can be quantified, visualized, and explored to uncover trends, guide policy and practice, and open\nnew avenues for legal research - work that lies squarely at the intersection of data science and law.\n# Case Study Material\nIn the Legal Text Mining project, you will receive a dataset provided by Open Legal Data. The dataset\nconsists of a pre-cleaned dump of court decisions enriched with basic metadata (court, chamber, date, ECLI,\ncitations).\n# Case Study Core Tasks\nIn the summer school project, you will develop an analytic pipeline to discover insights hidden in the large\namount of legal text, for example:\n• Topic & trend analysis:\ntracing how climate-risk litigation or consumer-protection disputes evolve across time and jurisdictions;\n• Citation and precedent networks:\nmapping which judgments or legislative acts act as hubs and how influence propagates through the\nlegal system;\n• Outcome modelling:\nlinking textual or structural features to damages, penalties, or success rates, and examining regional\nor court-level disparities;","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Install requires Libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -q datasets transformers scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2026-01-05T19:33:49.647215Z","iopub.execute_input":"2026-01-05T19:33:49.647613Z","iopub.status.idle":"2026-01-05T19:33:52.992658Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2026-01-05T19:33:49.647576Z","shell.execute_reply":"2026-01-05T19:33:52.991934Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I tried to load dataset directly throw kaggel dataset.
